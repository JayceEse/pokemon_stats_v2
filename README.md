# Pokemon Stats

A React-based web app that retrieves and displays Pokémon data using a public API. Users can search for a Pokémon by name and view its stats in a clean, responsive layout.

## Live Demo

Coming soon — will be deployed via Azure or AWS.

## Overview

This project allows users to enter the name of a Pokémon into a search bar and retrieve detailed stats using a public API.  
I built this project to learn how to integrate APIs into a React application, manage data fetching, and present dynamic content with responsive design.

This is a rebuild of a previous version — my goal this time is to write cleaner, more efficient code, reduce unnecessary API calls, and take what I’ve learned to the next level.
